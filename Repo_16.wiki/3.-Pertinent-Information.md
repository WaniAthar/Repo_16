# Robotic Arm that mimics Human Arm 

## Introduction


### A robot arm can carry out the assignment of a human arm with positive accuracy in which human intervention is a challenge. The present day paper depicts a layout and execution manner of a mechanical arm the use of Arduino-UNO which mimics the movement of human arm . Human Machine Interface is used for robots the use of DIY “Bend Sensors”, additionally acknowledged as “Flex Sensors” which matches on the premise of real muscular movements. The installation includes real interfacing of a human limb with the robot arm which makes maneuvering the robotic greater accurately.

### The human arm mimicking can also be done by controlling the arm using a mobile application or some controller. Where, each movement can be precisely controlled.

### Human arms have been putting together items in factories for years. Now, new arms, industrial robotic arms, are working in that same respect faster, more accurate rate.
### An industrial robot arm is a marvel of engineering in that it reacts similarly to our own arms. The robot arm closely resembles a human arm, with a wrist, forearm, elbow and shoulder. The six-axis robot has six degrees of freedom, allowing it to move six different ways, unlike the human arm, which has seven degrees of freedom.
### An industrial robot arm increases the speed of the manufacturing process, accuracy and precision. These robotic arms cut down on worker error and labour costs.
### The industrial robotic arm, which is usually made of steel or cast iron is built from the base up, ending with the wrist and whatever end effector is needed to perform the arm’s chosen task. A robotic controller rotates motors that are attached to each joint. Some of the larger arms, used to lift heavy payloads, are run by hydraulic and pneumatic means.

## **Da Vinci Surgical bot**

### The da Vinci surgical system gives your surgeon an advanced set of instruments to use in performing robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgery. The term “robotic” often misleads people. Robots don’t perform surgery. Your surgeon performs surgery with da Vinci by using instruments that he or she guides via a console.


### The da Vinci system translates your surgeon’s hand movements at the console in real time, bending and rotating the instruments while performing the procedure. The tiny wristed instruments move like a human hand, but with a greater range of motion. The da Vinci vision system also delivers highly magnified, 3D high-definition views of the surgical area. The instrument size makes it possible for surgeons to operate through one or a few small incisions.
