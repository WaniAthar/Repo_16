| Design 3 | Cost           | -5    | It is costly as it involves many fingers-- many motors and complex dynamics |
| .        | Quick Response | 5     | It is dependant on the human operating speed as it is operated using buttons  |
| .        | Safety         | 0     | It is safe as it doesn't require the controller to control directly             |
| .        | Ease of Use    | -9    | It has many fingers so controlling each of them is hard                     |
| .        | Usability      | 7     | It doesn't have any exposed wires/sensors so, it is easy to maintain        |
| .        | Space          | 4     | It is a nice little bot, doesn't require much space.                          |
